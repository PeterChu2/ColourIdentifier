Identi-Color
================

An app that returns a word description of the color shown at a specific point on the camera preview. Contains a large database of colors. Supports zoom functionality and use of camera flash for undesirable lighting conditions. The application was designed for color-blind people, the visually-impaired and designers, but can be a cool app for everyone! The app also has a built-in logging feature to record logged colors and their corresponding hex code.

Identi-Color has now been released on the android play store. Get it here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.forCHUApps.identi_Color&hl=en
