ColourIdentifier
================

An app that returns a word description of the colour shown at a specific point on the camera preview. Contains a large database of colours. Supports zoom functionality and use of camera flash for undesirable lighting conditions. The application was designed for colour-blind people, the visually-impaired and designers, but can be a cool app for everyone! The app also has a built-in logging feature to record logged colours and their corresponding hex code.
